## Tech Stack

HeatGen is built using a combination of technologies designed to deliver a robust and scalable solution for real-time heatmaps and user behavior analytics. Below is an overview of the tech stack used in the HeatGen project:

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that allows for efficient UI development and management.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It helps in building SEO-friendly pages and improving performance.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript enhances code quality and development experience with type safety.
- **Recharts**: A charting library for React, used for visualizing data through charts and graphs.
- **ShadCN**: A design system or component library used for consistent UI elements and styling.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used for generating statistical analysis and interacting with the Node.js server.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the client and server.


### Tools and Libraries

- **Heatmap.js**: A JavaScript library used for generating heatmaps based on user cursor movements.

### Development Environment

- **Visual Studio Code**: A popular code editor used for writing and managing the project's codebase.
- **Postman**: A tool for testing APIs and managing HTTP requests.

This tech stack ensures that HeatGen is built on a modern, efficient, and scalable foundation, allowing for real-time data processing and a smooth user experience.
